# ch1tty goal-driver board

Fallback board — Notion API token invalid (401). This file is the cross-run durable state.
Blocker to restore Notion: rotate `NOTION_API_TOKEN` (op://ChittyOS-Integrations/notion/api_token).

NOTE: Previous runs stored this file as base64, causing 2000-byte truncation. Restored as plain text (run 146).

## Blockers

- **Notion API token** — Invalid (401). Human action: `chitty-mcp-token notion` or rotate token in 1Password.
- **Ledger DLQ** — 11+ entries: `ledger.chitty.cc` unreachable from remote container. **Replay code merged (PR #815)** — entries will auto-replay once chittyos backend reconnects. Remaining action: configure CF Access credentials (`CHITTY_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` / `CHITTY_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`) on the production server so the chittyos backend can connect.
- **CI (main ci.yml)** — 0-jobs queue failure (non-CodeQL). Only CodeQL runs on PRs. Recurring pattern, non-blocking.

## Run Log

_(Prior run log entries archived to git history — runs 1–123 trimmed for readability.)_

### 2026-06-24 (idle — 121st run; all workstreams done)
- **Workstream**: None (all A–E + F–AAAAAAAAA + SEC-FIX 1–4 + GUARDRAIL-CLEANUP done)
- **Branch/PR**: direct commit to main (no new source changes)
- **Build**: clean (`tsc` exit 0, ch1tty@4.1.0) | **Tests**: 1368 pass / 0 fail / 2 skip (45 suites, 1370 total)
- **Actions**:
  - `npm ci` clean, `npm run build` clean (tsc exit 0), `npm test`: 1368/0/2 — unchanged from runs 100–120.
  - `git fetch --all` — 800+ rogue `auto/*-cast-explain-*-ratio` branches on remote; 0 open PRs; guardrail enforced.
  - All workstreams A–E + F–AAAAAAAAA + SEC-FIX 1–4 + GUARDRAIL-CLEANUP confirmed DONE (121st consecutive idle run).

- **Blockers**: Notion unavailable (401). Ledger DLQ (CF Access on prod). Ch1tty MCP unavailable. ch1tty github backend: unavailable (GITHUB_MCP_AUTHORIZATION unset). Branch delete: 403 (must run locally). Ollama unreachable (non-blocking).

### 2026-06-27 (idle — run 193; all workstreams done)
- **Workstream**: None — all A–E + F–AAAAAAAAA + SEC-FIX 1–4 + GUARDRAIL-CLEANUP done; no new workstreams defined.
- **Branch/PR**: direct commit to main (run log only; no source changes); merged PR #993 (run 192 idle log, 3/3 CI green)
- **Build**: clean (`tsc` exit 0, ch1tty@4.1.0) | **Tests**: 1368 pass / 0 fail / 2 skip (45 suites, 1370 total)
- **Actions**:
  - `npm ci` clean, `npm run build` clean (tsc exit 0), `npm test`: 1368/0/2 — unchanged from all prior runs.
  - `git fetch --all`: 964 remote branches (800+ rogue `auto/*-cast-explain-*-ratio`); 1 open PR (#993 run-192 log) — merged via squash (86fc6e2).
  - All workstreams A–E + F–AAAAAAAAA + SEC-FIX 1–4 + GUARDRAIL-CLEANUP confirmed DONE (193rd consecutive idle run).
  - `buildCastExplanation` metric freeze ACTIVE — source clean; 0 open PRs from prohibited branches.
  - Notion: unavailable (401). Ch1tty MCP: unavailable. GitHub MCP: connected. PushNotification: silent (idle, nothing new).
  - No source code changes this run.
- **State summary**: A ✅ B ✅ C ✅ D ✅ E ✅. Tests: 1368/0/2. Build: clean. **193rd consecutive idle run.**
- **Human action required** (same blockers — 193rd iteration):
  1. **Disable or redirect hourly schedule** — 193 idle runs with no new work; every run costs compute and adds stale entries.
  2. **Add new workstreams** to DRIVER-BOARD.md if planned work exists.
  3. **Configure CF Access on prod** (`CHITTY_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` / `CHITTY_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`) — clears ledger DLQ entries.
  4. **Set `GITHUB_MCP_AUTHORIZATION`** on prod to reconnect ch1tty github backend.
  5. **Rotate Notion token** — `op://ChittyOS-Integrations/notion/api_token`.
  6. **Stale branch cleanup** — 964 rogue `auto/` branches; run `git push --delete` locally or enable auto-delete in GitHub Settings.
