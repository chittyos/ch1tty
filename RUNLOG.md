## Run log

### 2026-06-09 (run 50)
- **Workstream advanced**: D — scenario testing
- **Branch/PR**: `auto/D-expand-sim-scenarios` → https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/295
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 100% line/branch/fn coverage
- **Simulation**: 37/37 resolution, 14/14 OOF reachability, 3/3 failure scenarios
- **What was done**: Added 8 new scenarios targeting thin profiles — design (3→5), finance (4→6), code (4→6), communication (4→6). Each scenario exercises a credible near-miss to test resolution rather than enumeration.
- **Blocker**: Notion wrapper missing at `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/notion-mcp-wrapper.sh` — board reads/writes impossible. Human must install.
- **Next run**: All 5 workstreams are complete. Next run should focus on extending E catalog (99th+ pass adding combos for newly exercised scenario tools), OR validate that PR #295 merged and trigger any remaining cleanup. If all workstreams remain done, consider adding OOF reachability probes for the 4 new focused scenario pairs (e.g. `playwright/click` reachable under finance focus).

### 2026-06-09 (run 51)
- **Workstream advanced**: E — Alchemist catalog 101st pass
- **Branch/PR**: `auto/E-catalog-101st-pass` → PR #298 (pending)
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected)
- **What was done**: Merged PR #297 (100th pass, ZERO partial-coverage gaps milestone). Added 101st pass: 12 combos + 12 prompts expanding single-use tools to new profiles (chittyevidence/log_evidence, orchestrator/agent_execute(claude), notion/API-delete-a-block, notion/API-update-a-data-source all expanded from 1/6 to 2-3/6). 5 new verified combos boost communication verified rate.
- **Catalog**: 1072→1084 combos / 480→485 verified / 1093→1105 prompts
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` needed to restore board writes
- **Next run**: 102nd catalog pass expanding remaining single-use tools to all 6 profiles; or mark E complete and focus on any new workstream.

- **Catalog**: 1152→1164 combos / 1173→1185 prompts / 496→508 verified.
- **CI note**: PR #303 shows `conclusion: failure` with 0 jobs — confirmed pre-existing environment artifact (same pattern on every branch including merged 105th-pass PR #302). Not caused by this change.
- **Bot comments**: Codex usage limit + CodeRabbit rate limit comments on PR — both bot notifications, no action needed.
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: 107th pass — target 3/6 tools: `cloudflare-builds/workers_builds_get_build_config` (needs finance+code+comm), `fs/directory_tree` (needs finance+governance+comm), `notion/API-create-a-page` (needs design+governance+comm), `orchestrator/agent_execute(claude)` (needs design+comm).

- **Workstream advanced**: E — Alchemist catalog 112th pass
- **Branch/PR**: `auto/E-catalog-112th-pass` → https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/310 (open)
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 0 fail
- **What was done**: 112th pass — 14 combos + 14 prompts completing **15 tools to 6/6** in a single pass (largest gain per pass yet). Grouped targets by shared missing profiles to maximise coverage per combo: 3 design combos, 2 governance, 4 finance, 2 communication, 2 code, 1 ops. One combo (`release-comms-schema-sprint`) required a chain fix to pass the comm-server validator (`tasks/get_task` added). 6/6 tool count: **153 → 168**. Total: **1238 combos / 1235 prompts**.
- **CI**: 2 CodeQL analysis jobs in-progress at log time. No review comments. Codex + CodeRabbit bots hit rate limits — no action needed.
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: 113th pass — target sub-6/6 tools at 2/6 that are genuinely cross-domain: `context7/get-library-docs` (now 3/6 after this pass, needs finance/design/communication), `fs/read_media_file`, `playwright/browser_fill`, `orchestrator/agent_execute(ui)`, `github/get_pull_request`, `orchestrator/skill_execute(chittyhelper:chittyhelper)`. With 16 combos these could all reach 6/6.

- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 0 fail
- **What was done**: 113th pass — **12 combos + 12 prompts** completing **2 tools to 6/6** and advancing 4 others. Note: branched from `auto/E-catalog-112th-pass` (PR #310 still open) to build on 1238-combo state. Completed: `context7/get-library-docs` (3/6→6/6 via +finance/+design/+communication combos), `orchestrator/skill_execute(chittyos-devops:chitty-deploy)` (3/6→6/6 via +finance/+governance/+communication combos). Advanced: `orchestrator/agent_execute(scrape)` (2/6→4/6, +code +ops), `neon/get_doc_resource` (2/6→3/6, +ops), `playwright/browser_fill` (2/6→3/6, +code), `playwright/browser_drop` (2/6→3/6, +design). 6/6 tool count: **168 → 170**. Total: **1250 combos / 1247 prompts**.
- **Fix**: Initial `playwright-test-then-commit` combo used only playwright+orchestrator servers; replaced third tool with `fs/write_text_file` to satisfy the code-profile server validator.
- **Workstream state**: A✅ B✅ C✅ D✅ E ongoing. B confirmed: servers.json uses `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` (deprecated package absent). C confirmed: focus.ts + focus-profiles.json (6 profiles), CH1TTY_FOCUS env var. D confirmed: 37 scenarios across 6 focus profiles (scenario.test.ts 1157 lines, simulation.test.ts 229 lines).
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: 114th pass — target 2/6 tools that are strategically valuable: `orchestrator/agent_execute(scrape)` (4/6, needs +finance +governance), `playwright/browser_fill` (3/6, needs +finance +governance +communication), `playwright/browser_drop` (3/6, needs +code +finance +ops), `neon/get_doc_resource` (3/6, needs +code +design +finance). 14 combos could reach all 4 to 6/6.

  - Pulled latest main (45bdce9). Designed QQQQ: `latencyMs` in `ch1tty/execute` responses — embeds into session metadata item (`{ latencyMs, sessionContext }`) when sessionId active + success; injects into dry_run JSON when `dryRun:true`; no-session non-dryRun unchanged (backward compat).
  - Implemented QQQQ: 2 files changed (`src/aggregator.ts` — execute case in `handleMetaTool`, tool description update; `test/qqqq-execute-latency-ms.test.ts` — 7 new tests).
  - Opened PR #458. CodeQL in_progress; CodeRabbit reviewing; Codex hit usage limits (no action needed).
  - Updated DRIVER-BOARD.md: PPPP marked done, QQQQ added.
- **Board**: PPPP ✅ QQQQ open (#458)
- **Next run priority**:
  1. Check PR #458 — if CodeQL green, merge it.
  2. Plan RRRR: candidates include (a) `ch1tty/search` `latencyMs` (times the registry fetch + scoring — no backend, but useful for diagnosing slow registry caches), (b) `ch1tty/reload` enriched response (add `latencyMs` for how long hot-reload took + `serversAdded`/`serversRemoved` diff vs prior config), (c) `ch1tty/execute` `latencyMs` for no-session path (currently backward-compat omitted), (d) a coverage sweep for any new branch gaps introduced by QQQQ.

### 2026-06-20 (run 37 — current)
- **Workstream advanced**: None — all workstreams complete; idle run
- **Branch/PR**: none
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 1344 pass, 0 fail, 2 skipped
- **What was done**:
  - Startup: `npm ci` clean, `npm run build` clean, 1344/0/2. No open PRs on GitHub.
  - Verified all workstreams A–E and all F+ observability extensions complete (186 done, 0 open on DRIVER-BOARD.md).
  - Closed stale duplicate [ ] SEC-FIX entry on DRIVER-BOARD.md (PR #773 was already merged and marked [x] on the adjacent line).
  - Gateway status: version 4.1.0, 15 servers (8 connected), 66 tools, 134 active sessions. `systemHealth.status: "degraded"` due to `ledgerStatus: "degraded"` (DLQ has 8 entries from session `cc-session-2`, 2026-06-20T14:05:52 — ledger backend endpoint unreachable so replay is not clearing). Embedding brain: 0/17 successes, 24 timeouts (embedding service down), circuit not open. Both are persistent infrastructure issues, not code defects.
  - Observed 30+ rogue `auto/NN-cast-explain-*` remote branches (e.g. `auto/01010101-cast-explain-runner-up-score-to-median-ratio`) — all violate the `buildCastExplanation` metric freeze guardrail in CLAUDE.md. None have open PRs; main was patched twice (PRs #827, #811). Branches are dead weight in remote but harmless. Code in `src-stdio/aggregator.ts` has no new violations.
  - Notion not accessible (auth 401); RUNLOG.md remains fallback cross-run board.
- **Workstream state**: A✅ B✅ C✅ D✅ E✅ F-RRRR+ ✅ SEC-FIX✅. No open workstreams.
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — RUNLOG.md is cross-run fallback board. Fix: rotate `NOTION_API_TOKEN` at op://ChittyOS-Integrations/notion/api_token.
- **Next run priority**:
  1. All workstreams done. Check for new Dependabot alerts (security).
  2. If ledger DLQ grows beyond 20 entries, investigate whether the ledger endpoint is permanently gone or needs config update.
  3. If new guardrail-violating branches appear, reject any associated PRs and note the pattern.

### 2026-06-20 (run 38 — current)
- **Workstream advanced**: None — all workstreams complete; idle run
- **Branch/PR**: none
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 1344 pass, 0 fail, 2 skipped
- **npm audit**: 0 vulnerabilities
- **What was done**:
  - Startup: `npm ci` clean, `npm run build` clean, `npm test` 1344/0/2 (45 suites, 1346 total).
  - Read CLAUDE.md + CHITTY.md; confirmed architectural guardrails (5-tool surface, buildCastExplanation freeze).
  - Checked DRIVER-BOARD.md + RUNLOG.md (37th run entry at bottom).
  - Verified all deliverables in place: `focus-profiles.json` (6 profiles), `focus-suggestions.json` (~1.8 MB, ~1750 combos), `src/focus.ts`, `src-stdio/suggestions.ts`, `test/scenario.test.ts`, `test/simulation.test.ts`.
  - Confirmed `src-stdio/aggregator.ts` has 0 `cast-explain` occurrences — source metric cleanup from PR #827 is still clean.
  - Confirmed `servers.json` GitHub entry uses official hosted remote endpoint (`https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`) — workstream B migration intact.
  - No open PRs; no new Dependabot/audit vulnerabilities.
  - 730 stale `auto/` branches on remote (259 are cast-explain ratio violation branches; all harmless, no open PRs from them).
  - Notion: 401 (persists). RUNLOG.md remains fallback cross-run board.
- **Workstream state**: A✅ B✅ C✅ D✅ E✅ F-RRRR+ ✅ SEC-FIX✅. No open workstreams.
- **Blockers**: Notion auth 401 (rotate `NOTION_API_TOKEN` at op://ChittyOS-Integrations/notion/api_token). Ledger DLQ (ledger.chitty.cc unreachable — persistent infra issue).
- **Next run priority**:
  1. All workstreams done. System healthy. If Notion token is rotated, first run will restore board access.
  2. If new guardrail violations appear (new cast-explain ratio branches or PRs), reject them per CLAUDE.md binding freeze.
  3. Consider adding new workstreams if any planned (new `apps/*-mcp` surface, cast chain improvements, new backends).
