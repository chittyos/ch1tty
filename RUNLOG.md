# ch1tty goal-driver run log

_Notion board unavailable in this environment (no `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/notion-mcp-wrapper.sh`). Run log committed here as fallback. Human must install the wrapper or set NOTION_API_KEY to restore Notion access._

| C. Focus-profile layer | ✅ DONE — `focus.ts`, `focus-profiles.json`, 6 profiles, `CH1TTY_FOCUS` env wired |
| D. Scenario testing | ✅ DONE (extended this run) — 37 scenarios, 29/29→37/37 passing |

## Run log

### 2026-06-09 (run 50)
- **Workstream advanced**: D — scenario testing
- **Branch/PR**: `auto/D-expand-sim-scenarios` → https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/295
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 100% line/branch/fn coverage
- **Simulation**: 37/37 resolution, 14/14 OOF reachability, 3/3 failure scenarios
- **What was done**: Added 8 new scenarios targeting thin profiles — design (3→5), finance (4→6), code (4→6), communication (4→6). Each scenario exercises a credible near-miss to test resolution rather than enumeration.
- **Blocker**: Notion wrapper missing at `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/notion-mcp-wrapper.sh` — board reads/writes impossible. Human must install.
- **Next run**: All 5 workstreams are complete. Next run should focus on extending E catalog (99th+ pass adding combos for newly exercised scenario tools), OR validate that PR #295 merged and trigger any remaining cleanup. If all workstreams remain done, consider adding OOF reachability probes for the 4 new focused scenario pairs (e.g. `playwright/click` reachable under finance focus).
