## Run log

### 2026-06-09 (run 50)
- **Workstream advanced**: D — scenario testing
- **Branch/PR**: `auto/D-expand-sim-scenarios` → https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/295
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 100% line/branch/fn coverage
- **Simulation**: 37/37 resolution, 14/14 OOF reachability, 3/3 failure scenarios
- **What was done**: Added 8 new scenarios targeting thin profiles — design (3→5), finance (4→6), code (4→6), communication (4→6). Each scenario exercises a credible near-miss to test resolution rather than enumeration.
- **Blocker**: Notion wrapper missing at `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/notion-mcp-wrapper.sh` — board reads/writes impossible. Human must install.
- **Next run**: All 5 workstreams are complete. Next run should focus on extending E catalog (99th+ pass adding combos for newly exercised scenario tools), OR validate that PR #295 merged and trigger any remaining cleanup. If all workstreams remain done, consider adding OOF reachability probes for the 4 new focused scenario pairs (e.g. `playwright/click` reachable under finance focus).

### 2026-06-09 (run 51)
- **Workstream advanced**: E — Alchemist catalog 101st pass
- **Branch/PR**: `auto/E-catalog-101st-pass` → PR #298 (pending)
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected)
- **What was done**: Merged PR #297 (100th pass, ZERO partial-coverage gaps milestone). Added 101st pass: 12 combos + 12 prompts expanding single-use tools to new profiles (chittyevidence/log_evidence, orchestrator/agent_execute(claude), notion/API-delete-a-block, notion/API-update-a-data-source all expanded from 1/6 to 2-3/6). 5 new verified combos boost communication verified rate.
- **Catalog**: 1072→1084 combos / 480→485 verified / 1093→1105 prompts
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` needed to restore board writes
- **Next run**: 102nd catalog pass expanding remaining single-use tools to all 6 profiles; or mark E complete and focus on any new workstream.

### 2026-06-09 (run 52)
- **Workstream advanced**: E — Alchemist catalog 102nd pass

- **Catalog**: 1084→1098 combos / 485 verified (unchanged) / 1105→1119 prompts
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes. No Notion MCP in this environment.

- **Catalog**: 1098→1122 combos / 485 verified (unchanged) / 1119→1143 prompts
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: Continue 103rd+ passes: next best targets are tools at 2/6 that weren't expanded this pass (neon/fetch, notion/API-get-self, notion/API-retrieve-a-data-source, notion/API-update-a-data-source, playwright/browser_console_messages, orchestrator/chittyagent-resolve). OR run OOF reachability simulation probes for the 6 newly completed tools.

- **Catalog**: 1140→1152 combos / 485→496 verified / 1161→1173 prompts
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists. browser-rendering 401 this session.
- **Next run**: Continue 106th pass targeting tools at 2/6: `neon/fetch`, `notion/API-get-self`, `notion/API-retrieve-a-data-source`, `playwright/browser_console_messages`, `orchestrator/agent_execute(resolve)`, `cloudflare-builds/workers_builds_get_build_config`. Each needs 4 new profiles. OR probe OOF reachability for newly completed 6/6 tools.

### 2026-06-10 (run 55)

- **Branch/PR**: `auto/E-catalog-106th-pass` → PR #303 (open, watching)
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)

- **Catalog**: 1152→1164 combos / 1173→1185 prompts / 496→508 verified.
- **CI note**: PR #303 shows `conclusion: failure` with 0 jobs — confirmed pre-existing environment artifact (same pattern on every branch including merged 105th-pass PR #302). Not caused by this change.
- **Bot comments**: Codex usage limit + CodeRabbit rate limit comments on PR — both bot notifications, no action needed.
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: 107th pass — target 3/6 tools: `cloudflare-builds/workers_builds_get_build_config` (needs finance+code+comm), `fs/directory_tree` (needs finance+governance+comm), `notion/API-create-a-page` (needs design+governance+comm), `orchestrator/agent_execute(claude)` (needs design+comm).

- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 0 fail
- **What was done**: Merged PR #304 (107th pass, 1176 combos). 108th pass: **completed all 5 priority tools to 6/6** in one pass using multi-tool chain combos to cover multiple gaps per combo. `cloudflare-builds/workers_builds_get` +finance+governance+communication → 6/6 ✅; `notion/API-retrieve-a-data-source` +governance+design+communication → 6/6 ✅; `neon/fetch` +design+communication → 6/6 ✅; `notion/API-get-self` +design+communication → 6/6 ✅; `orchestrator/chittyagent-resolve` +design+communication → 6/6 ✅.

- **Catalog**: 1176→1188 combos / 1197→1209 prompts / 508 verified (unchanged)
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: 109th pass — target remaining sub-6/6 tools: `playwright/browser_console_messages` (4/6, needs +governance +communication), `orchestrator/agent_execute(claude)` (4/6, needs +design +communication), `notion/API-update-a-data-source` (3/6, needs +governance +communication +ops), `fs/directory_tree` (5/6, needs +governance), `cloudflare-builds/workers_builds_get_build_config` (5/6, needs +communication).

### 2026-06-10 (run 57)
- **Workstream advanced**: E — Alchemist catalog 112th pass
- **Branch/PR**: `auto/E-catalog-112th-pass` → https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/310 (open)
- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 0 fail
- **What was done**: 112th pass — 14 combos + 14 prompts completing **15 tools to 6/6** in a single pass (largest gain per pass yet). Grouped targets by shared missing profiles to maximise coverage per combo: 3 design combos, 2 governance, 4 finance, 2 communication, 2 code, 1 ops. One combo (`release-comms-schema-sprint`) required a chain fix to pass the comm-server validator (`tasks/get_task` added). 6/6 tool count: **153 → 168**. Total: **1238 combos / 1235 prompts**.
- **CI**: 2 CodeQL analysis jobs in-progress at log time. No review comments. Codex + CodeRabbit bots hit rate limits — no action needed.
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: 113th pass — target sub-6/6 tools at 2/6 that are genuinely cross-domain: `context7/get-library-docs` (now 3/6 after this pass, needs finance/design/communication), `fs/read_media_file`, `playwright/browser_fill`, `orchestrator/agent_execute(ui)`, `github/get_pull_request`, `orchestrator/skill_execute(chittyhelper:chittyhelper)`. With 16 combos these could all reach 6/6.

- **Build**: clean (`tsc`)
- **Tests**: 938/940 pass, 2 skipped (Ollama unreachable — expected), 0 fail
- **What was done**: 113th pass — **12 combos + 12 prompts** completing **2 tools to 6/6** and advancing 4 others. Note: branched from `auto/E-catalog-112th-pass` (PR #310 still open) to build on 1238-combo state. Completed: `context7/get-library-docs` (3/6→6/6 via +finance/+design/+communication combos), `orchestrator/skill_execute(chittyos-devops:chitty-deploy)` (3/6→6/6 via +finance/+governance/+communication combos). Advanced: `orchestrator/agent_execute(scrape)` (2/6→4/6, +code +ops), `neon/get_doc_resource` (2/6→3/6, +ops), `playwright/browser_fill` (2/6→3/6, +code), `playwright/browser_drop` (2/6→3/6, +design). 6/6 tool count: **168 → 170**. Total: **1250 combos / 1247 prompts**.
- **Fix**: Initial `playwright-test-then-commit` combo used only playwright+orchestrator servers; replaced third tool with `fs/write_text_file` to satisfy the code-profile server validator.
- **Workstream state**: A✅ B✅ C✅ D✅ E ongoing. B confirmed: servers.json uses `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` (deprecated package absent). C confirmed: focus.ts + focus-profiles.json (6 profiles), CH1TTY_FOCUS env var. D confirmed: 37 scenarios across 6 focus profiles (scenario.test.ts 1157 lines, simulation.test.ts 229 lines).
- **Blocker**: Notion auth 401 persists — `chitty-mcp-token notion` restores board writes.
- **Next run**: 114th pass — target 2/6 tools that are strategically valuable: `orchestrator/agent_execute(scrape)` (4/6, needs +finance +governance), `playwright/browser_fill` (3/6, needs +finance +governance +communication), `playwright/browser_drop` (3/6, needs +code +finance +ops), `neon/get_doc_resource` (3/6, needs +code +design +finance). 14 combos could reach all 4 to 6/6.
