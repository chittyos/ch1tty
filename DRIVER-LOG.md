# ch1tty goal-driver board (fallback — Notion auth blocked)

Notion auth returns 401. This file is the cross-run state fallback until the token is refreshed.
**To restore Notion board**: run `chitty-mcp-token notion` (or rotate the Notion integration token in the Notion workspace settings) and re-connect the `notion` server.

## Workstream checklist

- [x] **A** — Gateway up/refreshed/tested: build clean, 938 pass / 0 fail (2 skipped). Branch coverage 100%. ✅ DONE
- [x] **B** — GitHub MCP migration: `servers.json` `github` entry migrated to hosted remote `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` with `envHeaders: { "Authorization": "GITHUB_MCP_AUTHORIZATION" }`. Deprecated `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` removed. ✅ DONE
- [x] **C** — Focus-profile layer: `focus-profiles.json` (6 profiles: finance, governance, design, code, communication, ops), `src/focus.ts`, full aggregator integration (env `CH1TTY_FOCUS`, per-call `focus` param on `search`/`cast`, `status` reports active focus). Tests in `test/focus.test.ts` + coverage gap tests. ✅ DONE
- [x] **D** — Scenario testing + simulation: `sim/` harness (`scenarios.ts`, `run.ts`, `fixture-backend.ts`), `test/scenario.test.ts`, `test/simulation.test.ts`, cloudflare-builds ops coverage fixtures + scenarios. ✅ DONE
- [ ] **E** — Alchemist brainstorm: catalog in `focus-suggestions.json`. **IN PROGRESS** — 39th pass open at PR #232 (336 combos / 219 verified). Main at 324 combos (38th pass merged this run).

## Blocker

- **Notion auth invalid (401)**: `notion` MCP server connects but API calls fail. Fix: refresh the Notion integration token in workspace settings → Settings & Members → Connections → ch1tty integration, or run `chitty-mcp-token notion` to rotate via 1Password.

## Run log

### 2026-06-06 — Session 01M2AzerZ6VzVNMNJjxoXXuL

**Workstream advanced**: E (Alchemist brainstorm — catalog 33rd pass)

**What happened**:
- Startup: `npm ci` clean, `npm run build` clean, `npm test` → 938 pass / 0 fail / 2 skipped
- Found only 1 open PR: #223 (`auto/E-catalog-thirty-third-pass`, 33rd pass, 264 combos). Was based on 31st-pass main (`42d34eb`); main had advanced to 32nd pass (`3d82306`, 254 combos) via merged PR #222.
- Rebased `auto/E-catalog-thirty-third-pass` onto current main. 6 conflicts in `focus-suggestions.json` (all profile-array tail insertions); resolved additively — kept all 32nd-pass combos + added 10 new 33rd-pass combos. Updated `_comment` to "264 combos, 178 verified".
- Tests post-rebase: 938 pass / 0 fail.
- Force-pushed rebased branch. Updated PR #223 body to reflect rebase + evidence.
- Attempted Notion board update — server connected but API returns 401 (token expired). Created this fallback log.

**Branch / PR**: `auto/E-catalog-thirty-third-pass` → PR #223 (https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/223)

**Build + test counts**: build clean, 938 pass / 0 fail / 2 skipped

**Next run priority**:
1. Merge PR #223 (rebased, clean, tests green)
2. Start 34th catalog pass: verify the 4 unbound combos (tasks, token-ops, ship, notes agent) when orchestrator reconnects them; add `notes` agent combos (6 tools, currently unbound)
3. Fix Notion auth (see blocker above) to restore cross-run board state

### 2026-06-06 — Session 019DTPKCLKPr8ao5Di6FJjnW

**Workstream advanced**: E (Alchemist brainstorm — catalog 34th pass)

**What happened**:
- Startup: `npm ci` clean, `npm run build` clean, `npm test` → 938 pass / 0 fail / 2 skipped
- Found 2 open PRs: #223 (33rd catalog pass, 264/178, rebased on main), #224 (this DRIVER-LOG.md)
- Merged PR #223 (squash) → main now at 264 combos / 178 verified (33rd pass)
- Queried live gateway: 28 agents / 15 bound; 54 skills synced via `orchestrator/skill_list`
- Discovered 9 agents not yet fully covered: alchemist (bound!), registry (bound), market (bound), chatgpt (bound), notes (unbound/6 tools), ui (unbound), claude (unbound), resolve (unbound), neon (unbound)
- Created branch `auto/E-catalog-thirty-fourth-pass`; added 12 new combos across 6 profiles
- One test failure found: `suggestions.test.ts` "code profile combos reference code-relevant backends" — `mcp-server-build-registry-market-launch` chain had no code-relevant server. Fixed by adding `notion/API-post-page` to chain.
- Tests after fix: 938 pass / 0 fail / 2 skipped
- Pushed branch, opened PR #225

**Branch / PR**: `auto/E-catalog-thirty-fourth-pass` → PR #225 (https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/225)

**Build + test counts**: build clean, 938 pass / 0 fail / 2 skipped

**Next run priority**:
1. Merge PR #225 (34th pass, 276/185, tests green)
2. 35th catalog pass: verify agents with tool counts that are unbound (notes=6, ship=8, dispute=7) when they rebind; add `storage` agent combos (document-storage, r2-management, legal-holds)
3. Fix Notion auth to restore cross-run board state (see blocker above)

### 2026-06-06 — Session (auto-driver run)

**Workstream advanced**: E (Alchemist brainstorm — catalog 37th pass)

**What happened**:
- Startup: `npm ci` clean, `npm run build` clean, `npm test` → 938 pass / 0 fail / 2 skipped
- Found 4 open PRs: #224 (DRIVER-LOG.md), #225 (34th pass), #226 (35th pass), #227 (36th pass)
- Merged PR #224 (DRIVER-LOG.md fallback board) → main
- Merged PR #225 (34th pass, 276/185) → main squash
- PR #226 (35th pass) had rebase conflict due to squash-merge strategy → created catch-up branch `auto/E-catalog-catch-up-35-36` applying 36th-pass end state (300 combos) cleanly on top of 34th-pass main
- Closed PR #226 and PR #227 as superseded; merged catch-up PR #228 (300 combos / 207 verified)
- Queried live gateway: 28 agents / 15 bound, 54 skills — discovered 5 new `chittycommand-alpha` dispute skills (strategy/intake/evidence/tracker/drafting) never cataloged in any prior pass
- Also cataloged: `feature-dev:feature-dev` plugin, `workflow:machine-management` skill
- Created branch `auto/E-catalog-thirty-seventh-pass`; added 12 new combos (2 tests failed on first run: chain format `skill_execute(x)` lacked `orchestrator/` prefix; code combo lacked code-server — both fixed)
- Pushed and merged PR #229 (312 combos / 219 verified)
- Main now at **312 combos / 219 verified** (37th pass)

**Branch / PR**: `auto/E-catalog-thirty-seventh-pass` → PR #229 (https://github.com/chittyos/ch1tty/pull/229)

**Build + test counts**: build clean, 938 pass / 0 fail / 2 skipped

**Next run priority**:
1. 38th catalog pass: `orchestrator` agent has 13 tools (status `unbound` in agent_list) — catalog combos using its specific tools (agent_search, skill_search, agent_execute, skill_execute, agent_list, skill_list + others); `resolve` agent combos when it binds (error-triage, severity-classification, auto-resolution); `storage` agent (document-storage, r2-management, legal-holds, AI classification — unbound)
2. Fix Notion auth to restore cross-run board state (see blocker above)

### 2026-06-06 — Session 01C5BkrtXTpka9cyvhqeqeCE
